What prompts were used
- we prompted one LLM to discuss a topic from the perspective of the article to another LLM in a conversation style, and after each answer measure the other model's political alignment using a political compass test.
What kind of responses were received
- results of the political compass test in terms of coordinates at each stage of the conversation
How might you improve your experiment?
- develop a more refined political compass test (current one is open sourced) 
What variables do you intend to vary?
- we intend to vary the LLM and Article source/topic
How will you expand on your starting experiment?
- more article topics, more analysis on how the political alignment shifted throughout the conversation
How might you automate largescale data collection?
